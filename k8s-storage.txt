✅ Full Explanation of the Kubernetes Storage Concepts Diagram

The diagram is divided into four major parts:

PodSpec → Volumes → VolumeMounts

PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

PersistentVolume (PV)

StorageClass (SC)

And additional features like snapshots, cloning, modes, phases, etc.

Let’s break each one down in simple terms.

🟣 1. PodSpec (How Pods use storage)

Inside a Pod, you define:

✔ volume

A volume in the PodSpec refers to some storage.
This storage may come from:

EmptyDir

ConfigMap

Secret

PVC (most commonly for persistent storage)

✔ containers → volumeMount

Each container inside the pod mounts the defined volume at a specific path.

Example:

volumeMounts:
  - name: mydata
    mountPath: /var/data


So Pod → volume → volumeMount simply explains how a pod accesses storage.

🔵 2. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

PVC is what the application asks Kubernetes for.

A PVC defines:
(a) Access Modes

These define how the volume can be accessed:

RWO — ReadWriteOnce
Only one node can mount it read-write.

ROX — ReadOnlyMany
Many nodes can mount, but read-only.

RWX — ReadWriteMany
Many nodes can mount read-write.

(b) StorageClass

Which StorageClass to use.
This selects the type of disk—EBS, NFS, Ceph, local PVs, etc.

(c) Size

How much storage you need.

Example:

resources:
  requests:
    storage: 10Gi

(d) LimitRange

Admins can enforce:

minimum size

maximum size

storage limits

🟣 Binding: PVC ↔ PV (1-to-1 binding)

Once a PVC is created:

Kubernetes finds a suitable PersistentVolume (PV)

The PVC binds 1-to-1 to the PV

This is an important rule → one PVC can bind to only one PV.

🟢 3. PersistentVolume (PV)

PV is the actual storage resource.

PV has two major parts:
(A) Modes

PVs can be used in two ways:

1. Filesystem

A standard mounted filesystem (most common).

2. Raw Block (beta)

Direct block device access (e.g., for databases needing very fast I/O).

(B) PV Phases / Status

PVs go through these states:

1. Available

PV exists but not yet bound.

2. Bound

PV is attached to a PVC → Ready to use.

3. Released

PVC is deleted but PV is not reused yet.

4. Failed

Errors in releasing or reclaiming the PV.

New Related PV Features
✔ VolumeSnapshot (alpha)

Create point-in-time snapshots of volumes.

✔ VolumeClone (beta)

Clone an existing PVC into a new PVC.

🟡 4. StorageClass (SC)

StorageClass defines the type of storage that should be created.

Enables Dynamic Provisioning

If a PVC requests a StorageClass:

Kubernetes automatically creates a new PV using the Provisioner.

There are two kinds of provisioners:
1. Internal provisioner

Kubernetes manages provisioning internally.

2. External provisioner

A controller (running inside the cluster) provisions volumes.
Used by cloud providers like:

AWS EBS

GCP PD

Azure Disk

Ceph

NFS provisioner

Reclaim Policy

What happens to the PV after PVC is deleted?

✔ Retain

Keep the volume; admin must manually clean up.

✔ Delete

Automatically delete the underlying storage. (Most common)

✔ Recycle (deprecated)

Old method—clears data and reuses. No longer recommended.

🎯 Summary: How the storage workflow works

Application Pod needs storage → refers to a volume

Pod uses a PVC to ask Kubernetes for storage

PVC matches/binds to a PV

StorageClass can dynamically create the PV

Pod mounts the PV using volumeMount

Provisioners and reclaim policies manage lifecycle

Optional snapshot/clone features enhance storage flexibility

⭐ Final Simple Explanation (in 3 lines)

PVC = Request for storage

PV = Actual storage

StorageClass = Template for creating storage dynamically

And PodSpec uses them through volumes and volumeMounts.
